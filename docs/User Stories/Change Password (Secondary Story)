As a user I want to change my account’s password. I click on the button that says “Change Password” which brings me to another page. On that page, I need to log in if I’m not already logged in. After logging in, I can enter my new password in the box of that page. After I hit enter, I’ll see a pop up page with “You have successfully changed your password ”
